Spatial Data Science with R - one-day course, NYC, Oct 17 2019

Instructor: Edzer Pebesma, https://twitter.com/edzerpebesma https://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/institute/staff/index.php/119/Edzer_Pebesma

Purpose: Getting familiar with the different types of spatial data, their handling and representation in R, typical operations on them, and the modeling of spatial data.

Outline of the day:
Morning: Basics of spatial data, handling spatial data in R
Spaces, how we measure space, Earth-bound data, coordinate reference systems
Points, lines, polygons, tesselations, rasters
Types of spatial data: objects, fields, aggregations
Standards for spatial data: simple features, coverages
R spatial: handling vector data with sf
R spatial: sf and tidyverse
R spatial: handling spatial data cubes with stars 
Combining different spatial datasets

Afternoon: Analysing and modeling spatial data in R
Point pattern data: modeling with spatstat
Geostatistical data: interpolation with gstat
Lattice (areal) data: modeling with spdep
If time permits: up- and downscaling spatial data


Packages used: sf, stars, sp, rgdal, rgeos, raster, gstat, spdep, spatstat, tidyverse

Prerequisites: Familiarity with R, curiosity for the story behind maps
